## Domian

_Domian is a Java implementation of the Evans/Fowler Specifications pattern. 
Domian is compact, simple, and embraces fluent interfaces._

...

The project is kind of a dormant.
It is hosted on Sourceforge.net like we used to do 5 years ago :-)
I will probably move it to GitHub if it is ever resurrected.
Here are the links to it.
